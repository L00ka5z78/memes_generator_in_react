## Hey there!
Here is a project of memem generator app where you can add your upper and bootm tex and generate random meme

It was created during ReactJs ourse I took lately. Actually it was following tutorial, but after that I created it
from scratch on my own, and you know what, I made it. It gaveme a lot of joy and satisfaction, and this is the reason
I decided to publish it. 
Of course its a simple project and nothing special at all, but it required to show some react thinking
and create some smart sollution. Some people may laugh at it, but Im proud :)

Tech stack:
ExpressJs, Javascript, React, no database, memes fetched from url.
